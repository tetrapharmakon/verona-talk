* Formal Category Theory
** What it is and why we care about it

The purpose of category theory is to try
to describe certain general aspects of the structure of 
mathematics. Since category theory is also part of mathematics, this
categorical type of description should apply to it as well as
to other parts of mathematics. Saunders Mac Lane suggested the name "Formal
Category Theory" for this study. The basic idea is that the
category of small categories, Cat, is a 2-category with 
properties and that one should attempt to identify those properties
that enable one to do the "structural parts of category theory".
